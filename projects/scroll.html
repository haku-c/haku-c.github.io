        Is it possible, finally, for one human being to achieve perfect understanding of another?
      </p>
      <p>
        We can invest enormous time and energy in serious efforts to know another person, but in the end, how close are
        we
        able to come to that person's essence?
      </p>
      <p>
        We convince ourselves that we know the other person well, but do we really know anything important about anyone?

    <div class="quote"> I read that beauty has historically demanded replication. We make more of anything we find
      aesthetically
      pleasing, whether it's a vase, a painting, a chalice, a poem. We repoduce it in order to keep it, extend it
      through space and time. To gaze at what pleases—a fresco, a peach-red mountain range, a boy, the mole on his
      jaw—is in itself, replication—the image prolonged in the eye, making more of it, making it last. Staring into the
      mirror, I replicate myself into a future where I might no exist...

      I want to insist that our being alive is beautiful enough to be worthy of replication. And so what? So what if all
      I ever made of my life was more of it?

      I love short stories because I believe they are the way we live. They are what our friends tell us, in their pain
      and joy, their passion and rage, their yearning an their cry against injustice. We can sit all night with our
      friend while he talks about the end of his marriage, and what we finally get is a collection of stories about
      passion, tenderness, misunderstanding, sorrow, money; those hours and days and moments when he was absolutely
      married, whether he and his wife were screaming at each other, or sulking around the house, or making love. While
      his marriage was dying, he was also working; spending evenings with friends, rearing children, but those are other
      stories. Which is why, days after hearing a painful story by a friend, we see him and say: How are you? We know
      that by now he may have another story to tell, or he may be in the middle of one, and we hope it is joyful.

      If youth is the season of hope, it is often so only in the sense that our elders are hopeful about us; for no age
      is so apt as youth to think its emotions, partings, and resolves are the last of their kind. Each crisis seems
      final, simply because it is new.
